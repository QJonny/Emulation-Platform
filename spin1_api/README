CP Note (9th Oct 2013):

These files should not exist really.
They should use the spin1_api in the SpiNNaker package, which comes from the SVN repository.

A meld will how you how they differ, but they exist due to the locations of sections of 
SpiNNaker memory in the PC's memory mapped files, meaning that if you don't have 4GB of 
real PC memory you can't run the simulations.  This is due to the SpiNNaker positions 
of SDRAM and SYSRAM - which are in too high a place in the memory map for some machines.
There is also an extra event type to be considered.

TODO.
To harmonise this with the spinnaker package spin1_api folder and not have this local version.
